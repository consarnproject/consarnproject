Being able to have acquired some experience in consulting my experiences have accumulated to what I now describe as my passion. 
This being biodiversity and sustainability. My immediate goal and passion is to work in the B Corporation field as an analyst or consultant.
Through my research in fields such as Art Market Economics I have developed analytical skills and this has transformed into interests that include 
The Economic Valuation of Ecosystems & Biodiversity and the technology aspects associated with this such as Bioacoustics and Mapping Techniques.
